This project, FURLICENSE, is a digital system aimed at modernizing and streamlining the pet licensing process for cats and dogs. 
It allows pet owners to register and renew licenses online, eliminating the need for multiple visits to licensing offices. 
By providing a user-friendly interface, FURLICENSE enhances convenience, accessibility, and efficiency for users with busy schedules or limited mobility. 
Key features include online registration, license renewal, and a user dashboard for viewing pet details and license status. 
Administrators can manage user accounts, review applications, and control license validity. 
However, the system is limited to cats and dogs, does not allow users to edit submitted information, and lacks notifications for approved or declined requests. 
FURLICENSE promotes a more efficient and accessible licensing process, highlighting the potential for technology to improve public services.
